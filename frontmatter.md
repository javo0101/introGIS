# Introduction to Mapping

## Abstract

In the past decade, interactive maps have become one of the most popular ways to visualize and explore spatial data. Responding to the demand, mapping companies such as ESRI have developed a suite of tools for both creating and contextualizing interactive maps. While extremely helpful, some of the ESRI products are prohibitively expensive for many individuals. This workshop will use a combination of the public version of ESRI Online, which is free, and the free, open-source mapping software QGIS to build an interactive map. By the end of this workshop you will know the basics for making an interactive map that can be shared and embedded in a website. No mapping experience is necessary. 

## Learning Objectives
In this workshop, you will learn to:
- Become familiar with fundamental mapping concepts, such as how spatial data is organized and displayed. 
- Distinguish among two different forms of spatial data--vector data and raster data.
- Consider some of the core ethical dilemmas of mapmaking.
- Understand the difference between the most popular mapping software. 
- Import and export data between different mapping tools. 
- Combine data through performing a “spatial join.” 
- Turn a spreadsheet with location data into a map layer (the name of this process is “geocoding”).
Customize an interactive map.
- Add pop-ups to your map.
- Share your interactive map as a URL or embed it in a website. 


## Estimated time

4 hours.

## Prerequisites

- [Data Literacies](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/data-literacies) (optional)

## Datasets

- Please download the dataset [here](<https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/mapping/tree/v2.0-olivia-edits/dataset>).
- Check out a version of the map we are going to make in this workshop [here](<http://arcg.is/1KyC9O >).

## Installations
In this section, we outline a few steps to take before you get started with this workshop. For instance, you will need to download the mapping software QGIS. You will also need to create an account for ESRI Online. And lastly, we recommend that you download the data needed for the workshop.

Software installations
- To complete this workshop you will need to install QGIS. 
    - For step by step [installation instructions](<https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/main/sections/qgis.md>).
- Create a free ESRI Online [Public account.](<https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-started/create-account.htm>)

### Ethical Considerations
Starting from figuring out how to represent a 3D reality on a 2D plane, there are countless subjective decisions that every mapmaker must make, whether they are conscious of it or not. Mapmakers need to decide what data to represent and what to leave out. They also need to decide how to aggregate, categorize, project, combine, and visualize the data. All of these decisions will influence the story that the map tells. Additionally, as a critical tool of Western colonialism and imperialism, maps wield great authority. As mapmakers, it’s essential to be conscious of this history not to reproduce harmful power dynamics through mapmaking. Once something is visualized in the form of a map, it is often understood as a Truth representation of reality. Therefore, mapmakers have an important responsibility to be as honest and transparent as possible. Since the 1980’s, there have been two emerging disciplines in academia--critical cartography and feminist GIS--that have brought to light many of the harmful applications of mapping. Rather than reject mapping, they have made significant contributions to the field of GIS and mapping, such as counter mapping, sketch mapping, participatory mapping, qualitative GIS and 3D body-mapping. The following readings will introduce you to some of the fundamental insights from critical cartography and feminist GIS that you can integrate into your mapping journey. The reading list also includes modern-day counter mapping projects.
