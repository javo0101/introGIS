## Projects or Challenges to Try

- Try adding context to your interactive map by turning it into an [ESRI Story Map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/cea22a609a1d4cccb8d54c650b595bc4). Story maps are a free ESRI application for creating multi-media narratives. You can use the same map that you made in ESRI's ArcGIS Online program and import it into its Story Map application to add text, photos and video. You can even take the reader to different points around the map and give them information about each location.

## Discussion Questions

- In the workshop we learned that every map should begin with a simple and answerable research question. What else makes for a good mapping research question? Remember that maps can be exploratory so we don't need to fully answer the question. 
- What makes a map ethical or unethical?
- Think about the audience or audiences for your map. Do you think different audiences should warrent constructing the map in different ways?
